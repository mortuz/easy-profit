                                is taken for cash flow shortages then the loan must equal the cash shortage for the month
                                cash at the bank goes negative. During that same month, an entry must be made on the Balance

                                entry is made, the cash at the bank changes from negative to zero. Circle the negative amount
                                in red indicating it was covered by a loan and write $0 next to it indicating the cash at

                                from the possibilities and discussion around the card requirements.

                                INCOME: Income is generally the top portion of the Income Statement which is also referred to as the Profit & Loss Statement,
                                P&L or P&L Statement. Income includes all funds flowing into the entity for any reason. Income
                                could be earned income, refund expenses, one-time income, recurring income, or other income.
                                Income may also be referred to using the term “revenue.” At times and for accounting reasons,
                                income may be shown as a negative number. An example of negative income may be a refund to
                                a customer.

                                TOTAL INCOME: Total Income is the sum (total or all income added together) of all income. This total is derived by adding
                                up all of the income.

                                EXPENSES: Expenses represent outflows of cash or assets to the company. Expenses are separated into Transactional and Operations.
                                Expenses could be the cost of goods used to make a product, labor, insurance, taxes, equipment
                                or other fees paid out. For the game, calculate the expenses as a percentage of the income
                                for the same month.

                                THE BOTTOM LINE: The Bottom Line is derived by subtracting the total expenses from the total income. The goal of business
                                is to have a positive Bottom Line meaning the company made more money than it spent. A positive
                                Bottom Line is also called “being in the black” versus a negative Bottom Line is referred
                                to as “being in the red.”

                                REGION, VEHICLE PAYMENT & REVENUE PER CONTRACT: The region is going to be an assigned city. Vehicle payment amount is equal
                                to your monthly vehicle payment which is determined at the start of the game using the Regional
                                Assignment Sheet (see “LOANS”). Revenue per contact is based on the economic health of your
                                region which changes throughout the game. These values are determined before beginning play.

                            <li>ASSETS: Assets are a listing of the cash, inventory, land or buildings a company owns. To
                                determine the Cash at the bank, add the cash from last month to the Bottom Line from the
                                previous month. Other events such as loans or equity contributions can also affect the calculation
                                for cash at the bank (see “Loan” section for more details). Inventory is determined by the
                                inventory from the previous month and any of the same that was made or acquired in the current
                                month. Equipment, Real Estate or other long-term assets is determined by the value from the
                                previous month and any of the same acquired in the current month. Vehicles asset values are
                                entered when they are acquired at full purchase price and are depreciated each month equal
                                to the value of the payment. For the purposes of the game, the owner has donated inventory
                                and equipment which is also reflected in the owners equity.

                                LIABILITIES: Liabilities are a listing of the amounts owed to others. Loans are derived based on loans the company takes.
                                Loans are all decreased in the amount equal to the payments without consideration for interest.

                                OWNERS EQUITY: The Owners Equity is a real time representation of the value the owner has in the company. Although it is
                                commonly referred to using a percentage, on the Balance Sheet, it is a real number. The Capital
                                is steady from one month to the next unless additional capital is paid by the owner or if
                                the owner is paid a portion of their capital. Revenue is equal to the Total Income. Expenses
                                are equal to the Total Expenses. RETAINED EARNINGS are a sum of the following items: Revenue,
                                Expenses & Retained Earnings from the previous month.
                            </li>

                                TOTAL OWNERS EQUITY: To ensure the Balance Sheet is actually in balance, one can always add the Liabilities to the Owners
                                Equity and that should equal the Assets. This indicates the Balance Sheet is in balance.

                                month. Viewing the monthly values over time can show trends or annual cycles.
