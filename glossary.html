                                P&L or P&L Statement. Income includes all funds flowing into the entity for any reason. Income
                                could be earned income, refund expenses, one-time income, recurring income, or other income.
                                Income may also be referred to using the term “revenue.” At times and for accounting reasons,
                                income may be shown as a negative number. An example of negative income may be a refund to

                                TOTAL INCOME: Total Income is the sum (total or all income added together) of all income. This total is derived by adding
                                up all of the income.

                                Expenses could be the cost of goods used to make a product, labor, insurance, taxes, equipment
                                or other fees paid out. For the game, calculate the expenses as a percentage of the income

                                is to have a positive Bottom Line meaning the company made more money than it spent. A positive

                                to as “being in the red.”

                                Assignment Sheet (see “LOANS”). Revenue per contact is based on the economic health of your

                            <li>ASSETS: Assets are a listing of the cash, inventory, land or buildings a company owns. To
                                determine the Cash at the bank, add the cash from last month to the Bottom Line from the
                                previous month. Other events such as loans or equity contributions can also affect the calculation
                                for cash at the bank (see “Loan” section for more details). Inventory is determined by the
                                inventory from the previous month and any of the same that was made or acquired in the current
                                month. Equipment, Real Estate or other long-term assets is determined by the value from the
                                previous month and any of the same acquired in the current month. Vehicles asset values are
                                entered when they are acquired at full purchase price and are depreciated each month equal
                                to the value of the payment. For the purposes of the game, the owner has donated inventory
                                and equipment which is also reflected in the owners equity.

                                OWNERS EQUITY: The Owners Equity is a real time representation of the value the owner has in the company. Although it is
                                commonly referred to using a percentage, on the Balance Sheet, it is a real number. The Capital
                                is steady from one month to the next unless additional capital is paid by the owner or if
                                the owner is paid a portion of their capital. Revenue is equal to the Total Income. Expenses
                                are equal to the Total Expenses. RETAINED EARNINGS are a sum of the following items: Revenue,
                                Expenses & Retained Earnings from the previous month.

                                TOTAL OWNERS EQUITY: To ensure the Balance Sheet is actually in balance, one can always add the Liabilities to the Owners
                                Equity and that should equal the Assets. This indicates the Balance Sheet is in balance.

                            is also called gross margin. For example, if an organization buys in an item for $50 and sells

                            has enough cash or assets that will become cash so that it is able to write checks without running

                            Sales or Revenue &ndash; Sales or REV: Sales or Revenue is the income that flows into an organization, and it is often used
                            almost synonymously with sales. In government and nonprofit organizations it includes taxes and
                            grants. Don't confuse revenues with receipts. Under the accrual basis of accounting, revenues
                            are shown in the period they are earned, not in the period when the cash is collected. Revenues
                            occur when money is earned; receipts occur when cash is received.

                            Working Capital &ndash; WC: Working Capital is the difference between current assets and current liabilities. An organization
                            without sufficient working capital cannot pay its debts as they fall due. Poor financial management
                            practices can lead even a profitable company to close due to Working Capital shortages.
